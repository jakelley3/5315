      <h1>What is GIT? Why do we need source code Version Control System? </h1>
      <p>Git is a software that allows users to perform version control. Since most companies need to track coding changes throughout the lifespan of the project, Git provides a relatively easy solution. Git tracks who made the changes, when the changes were made, and can revert back to the original code as needed. Additionally, every Git directory on a given computer can access all of the code history, versions, and repositories. </p>
      <p>The Version Control System is important in allowing multiple developers to add code at the same time. It helps track the history of code changes over time and is imperative in real life projects to avoid any coding conflicts when multiple developers are working on the same project. </p>

      <h2>Describe following terms: 1) local repo 2) remote repo 3) how to use GIT in Team Project â€“ multiple developers work on the same project at the same time </h2>
      <p> Git utilizes two different types of repositories, local and remote. Local repositories are located on a user's computer, while remote repositories are usually located elsewhere. Git is such a great solution because it allows users to have full repository history in their local repository. Users can then pull and push their updated code to the central server, which is usually a remote repository. This is exactly how developers can use Git for team projects. Developers can copy the central repository over to their local repository. They are then allowed to make code changes without immediately effecting the central repository. When a user is ready to update their portion of the code, they "push" their changes back to the central repository. </p>
